\begin{abstract}
An implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network and logistic regression is presented, in which the effects of tuning different hyperparameters is made studying the 1D and 2D Ising model. As a verification, comparisons between 1D Ising model applied to ordinary least squares, Ridge and Lasso regression and the MLP is made, to which the MLP appears outperform the linear regression in certain aspects. For the 2D Ising model, we find that the optimal parameters for MLP seems to lie around a constant learning rate $\eta=0.001$, L$^2$ regularization strength $\lambda=0.1$, mini batch size in SGD(Stochastic gradient descent) for $N_\mathrm{mb}=20$, 20 hidden layer neurons. This produces after 500 epochs a accuracy of
