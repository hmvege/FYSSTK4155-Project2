\begin{abstract}
An implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network and logistic regression is presented, in which the effects of tuning different hyperparameters is made studying the 1D and 2D Ising model. As a verification, comparisons between 1D Ising model applied to ordinary least squares, Ridge and Lasso regression and the MLP is made, to which the MLP appears outperform the linear regression in certain aspects. For the 2D Ising model, we find that the optimal parameters for MLP seems to lie around $\eta= 1.0e-02$ and the optimal $\lambda \simeq 1.0e-02$ when we have about 20 neurons and run for 500 epochs. We found that $\tanh$ seems to be the optimal activation function in a neural net and that both linear and logistic regression had better R2 and accuracy scores respectively for Neural Nets compared to conventional methods.
